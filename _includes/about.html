              <br/>
                <p>When hunting for a house, finding out about a neighbourhood often relies on word-of-mouth and local knowledge that is hard to access or simply inaccurate.</p>
                <p>Weâ€™re solving this problem by augmenting online property listings with hyper-local data that gives you critical information at a glance, saving time and letting you make a more informed decision.</p>
                <p>The data is sourced from a wide range of locations, including the New Zealand Census and police crime statistics. A free browser extension has be created that formats and visualises this data, displaying it to home buyers as they browse property listings on TradeMe.</p>
